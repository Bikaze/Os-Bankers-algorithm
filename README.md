# Os-Bankers-algorithm
This algorithm is a simple simulator of how the bankers resolves Deadlocks<br>
This algorithm tests a situation and checks the system is in safe or unsafe state<br>
If it is in a safe state it will provide one of a number of possible safe sequences<br>
If it is in unsafe state it will alert you
